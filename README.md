	# This whole section is optional and only required if your $PATH settings are not set. If you are
	using MAMP, AMPSS, or some other boxed system you may need to specify these. Otherwise it is 
	recommended that you do not include this section.
	
    "php":   	"/path/to/php",
    # The path to the php executable that the tasks will run.

	 # The path to the drush executable that the tasks will run.
  },
  "build": {
  	# This section is entirely optional as well. Anything that is omitted will be prompted for
  	or expected to be passed in on the command line as an option. If a setting is included
  	in this section no prompt will be presented to the user for this option. These 
  	configuration options can be overridden by options passed in on the command line.

    # the root path to your webserver. This must be an absolute path WITH the trailing slash.
    
    "environment": 		"local",
    # What type of environment you are building to. eg: local, sites, anchorage. This variable
    changes how, and what gets installed on your build site. For example, local builds come

Commands
----

####`grunt build:upgrade:sites`

function is slightly different than the `build:upgrade` function in that it has some specific to sites
functionality that allow for a smoother upgrade and re-sync to sites process.

--features-revert-all
--build-product  
--build-type  
--build-environment
--build-directory

--baseurl
--legacy
```

####`grunt local:drush-aliases`
Generate a drush alias file for your environment. This will place a file at 
`~/.drush/local.aliases.drushrc.php`. Once that file is there you may have to do some additional 
configuration to get it to work.

####`grunt sites:clone`
Get a copy of a site from sites. 

Options available:

```
--sites-drush-alias
--sites-sunetid
--build-directory

```

####`grunt sites:drush-aliases`
Generate a drush alias file for the sites environment. This will generate a file at `~/.drush/sites.aliases.drushrc.php`. Once
this file is in place you will then be able to use Drush aliases to run commands on Stanford Sites websites. eg: drush @sse.ds\_sws-build-jsv and @uat.ds\_sws-build-jsv.

####`grunt shell:check-system-env`
Check system environment variables. Outputs the paths to the environment software that this tool uses. If anything is missing please get your
nearest friendly developer to help.
